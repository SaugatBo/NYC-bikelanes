  <h1> Build More Bike Lanes in the Least Served Neighborhoods </h1>
  <p id=byline> <i> By Saugat Bolakhe </i></p>

  <p> <b> Department of Transport Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez announced that the city is set to add more cycle lanes in coming years. But question remains whether the bike lanes would be prioritized on least served neighborhoods. </b>

  <p> On November 21, Department of Transportation commissioner, Ydanis Rodriguez, revealed plans to add more bike lanes in the city neighborhoods. But data indicates that the plan needs to be handled cautiously.
 </p>

  <p> NYC Environment and Health Data Portal indicates that there are still neighborhoods in Queens and Staten Island that have minimum number of bike lanes. Jamaica and Port Richmond are the least served neighborhoods.

  </div>

<p>
  Tomas Garita, Deputy Press Secretary at the New York City Department of Transportation said that the priority investment areas have been made focusing on where the bike lanes would have the greatest impacts. The department will be using metrics to design street plans, he added.
   “The priority investment areas are based on three factors including race/income, density and lack of prior investment.”
